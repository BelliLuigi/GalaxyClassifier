# GalaxyClassifier
Final project of the course Laboratory of Computational Physics Mod. B. We aim at analysing the [Galaxy Zoo](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/classify) dataset and build a Machine Learning tool able to classify the objects within the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/data).
