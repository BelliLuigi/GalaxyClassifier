# GalaxyClassifier
Final project of the course Laboratory of Computational Physics Mod. B. We aim at analysing the [Galaxy Zoo](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/classify) dataset and build a Machine Learning tool able to classify the objects within the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/data). 

Internal Supervisor: prof. Tiziano Zingales

# Using this repo
Do not. If you are reading these lines, you are possibly not a member of our group, this repo is the result of hours and hours of obsessed and possessed coding of four different people with very different views on what coding should be. You will not find anything useful in here. If you do, please report what you find. 

If you are keep reading, I, as the `README.md` file, I am very sorry for your endeavour of trying to put some sense in all of this.

* [CNNs.md](https://github.com/margherita-lera/GalaxyClassifier/blob/main/CNNs.md) Results, description, and considerations on the architectures we used.
* [Readdata.ipynb](https://github.com/margherita-lera/GalaxyClassifier/blob/main/Readdata.ipynb) Forgotten piece of code to visualize qt galaxies (comes in colours!).
* [charter.py](https://github.com/margherita-lera/GalaxyClassifier/blob/main/charter.py) Optuna script, not updated.
* [fisher.ipynb](https://github.com/margherita-lera/GalaxyClassifier/blob/main/fisher.ipynb) Contains our CNNs as pytorch classes, should be used to copy-paste when you want to load the models.
* [journal.md](https://github.com/margherita-lera/GalaxyClassifier/blob/main/journal.md) Day by day you shall write what you do. Fail you should, oblivion will follow, chaos, nightmares.
* [mapper.ipynb](https://github.com/margherita-lera/GalaxyClassifier/blob/main/mapper.ipynb) It possibly is some testing code. I dunno why it's here, neither it does. I would mercifully kill it.
* [optuna.ipynb](https://github.com/margherita-lera/GalaxyClassifier/blob/main/optuna.ipynb) Once it was the ultimate notebook to run our code, now it's obsolete, and it should not be run for **any** reason. The true working notebooks are scattered across the not so working branches. Perhaps one day one of them will be pushed in here. They are all different of course.
* [scaletta.md](https://github.com/margherita-lera/GalaxyClassifier/blob/main/scaletta.md) Ordered list of things to take care of. We stopped updating it the second day. Possibly only the original author has ever glanced at it once.
* [zookeeper.py](https://github.com/margherita-lera/GalaxyClassifier/blob/main/zookeeper.py) Custom package with a couple of functions to run the code.
